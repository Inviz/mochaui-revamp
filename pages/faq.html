	<dt>Can I use Mocha UI with Prototype?</dt>
	<dd>Maybe. Mootools and Prototype are not compatible, though you might try <a target="_blank" href="http://www.protolific.net/">ProtoSafe</a> which claims to help Mootools and Protoype work together. If your project is using Prototype, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prototype-ui.com/">Prototype UI</a> may be the way for you to go.</dd>

	<dt>How do I get Mocha UI to work with an older version of Mootools?</dt>
	<dd>I am not familiar with Mootools 1.11 and cannot help you. You will probably have to make a lot of changes. Mocha UI uses new Mootools 1.2 features extensively. You can post in the <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/mocha-ui">Mocha UI  Google Group</a> asking if anyone is currently working on a port or completed one for the versions of Mocha UI and Mootools you wish to use.</dd>
