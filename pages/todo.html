<h3>Todo for Milestone:</h3>
			
<ul>
	<li>Reorganize CSS.</li>	
	<li>Make sprites for dock tabs.</li>	
	<li>If you have three columns, two with the width set, what happens if the viewport is smaller than their width? Right now this throws an error in IE6 since IE6 has no min-width.</li>
	<li>Hide dock if there are no windows open.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Optional Todo:</h3>
				
<ul>
	<li>Consider making title tooltips optional and using them more often.</li>	
	<li>Add a "fixed" option, where the panel only resizes if the other panels reach 0 height.</li>
	<li>Consider adding a click event for focus to iframes whose source is on same domain. Add event to onComplete in Window.js.</li>
	<li>Create Illustrator source file for graphic assets.</li>
</ul>
