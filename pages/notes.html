	<h3>Themes</h3>

	<p>Themes are new and experimental. As they are developed their implementation may change a great deal, though their file structure will probably remain basically the same.</p>

	<p>Themes go in individual folders in the themes directory. Each theme needs an init file, css folder, and images folder.</p>

	<p>The CSS has been separated into style sheets that correspond with the various JavaScript files. Layout.css goes with Layout.js for instance. The style sheets that were in the css folder are now in themes/default/css/.</p>
	
	<p>If you want to be able to dynamically change themes (without a screen refresh), style sheet links in the page headers should follow the convention below. Each style sheet should have an id that is "css" + the file name minus the file extension. So the id for "Core.css" is "cssCore". There must then be a Core.css file in every theme's css folder.</p>
	
	<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" id="cssCore" href="themes/default/css/Core.css" /&gt;</pre>
	
	<p>In the theme-init.file you can currently change the following Window options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>headerStartColor</li>
		<li>headerStopColor</li>
		<li>bodyBgColor</li>
		<li>minimizeBgColor</li>
		<li>minimizeColor</li>
		<li>maximizeBgColor</li>
		<li>maximizeColor</li>
		<li>closeBgColor</li>
		<li>closeColor</li>
		<li>resizableColor</li>		
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can change the default theme in themes.js. You can change the themes directory path there as well.</p>		

	<p>If you don't wish to use Themes, remove the following line from mocha-init.js:</p>
	
	<pre>MochaUI.themeInit();</pre>

	<p>The contentBgColor option has been removed from the Window Class, and the panelBackground option has been removed from the Panel Class. You should now use CSS for changing these colors. The addClass option in both the Window Class and Panel Class is helpful when styling some windows or panels differently than others.</p>  

	<h3>Split Panels and Windows</h3>
	<p>Split panels and windows are new as well, though they should be production ready. If you find any bugs with them let me know.</p>
