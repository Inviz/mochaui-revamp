	<h3>Themes</h3>

	<p>Themes are new and experimental. As they are developed their implementation may change a great deal, though their file structure will probably remain basically the same.</p>

	<p>Themes go in individual folders in the themes directory. Each theme needs an init file in it's folder. The demo themes folders also have css and images folder in them.
Eventually most of the images in the current images directory will move to themes/default/images/. The css is going to being broken up at some point as well, and a good 
portion of that will go to themes/default/css/.</p>

	<h3>Split Panels and Windows</h3>
	<p>Split panels and windows are new as well, though they should be production ready. If you find any bugs with them let me know.</p>
