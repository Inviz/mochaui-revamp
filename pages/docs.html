<h3>Loading Content with an XMLHttpRequest(XHR)</h3>
<p>For content to load via xhr all the files must be online and in the same domain. If you need to load content from another domain or wish to have it work offline, load the content in a iframe instead of using the xhr option.</p>

<h3>Iframes</h3>
<p>There are at least three ways you can put Iframes in your windows. You can place an iframe in one of your mocha divs in the original index.html. You can use the iframe contentType option, which will place your content in an iframe for you though this gives you the least amount of control over the iframe's properties. You can load a page with an iframe in it into a window using xhr. The later option gives you the most control.</p>

<p>If you use the iframe contentType your iframe will automatically be resized when the window it is in is resized. If you want this same functionality when using one of the other load options simply add class="mochaIframe" to those iframes and they will be resized for you as well.</p>

<h3>Creating a Window Link</h3>

Example HTML:
<pre>
&lt;a id="docsLink" href="pages/docs.html"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

Example Javascript:
<pre>
	if ($('docsLink')){
		$('docsLink').addEvent('click', function(e){	
			new Event(e).stop();
			MochaUI.newWindow({
				id: 'docs',
				title: 'Documentation',
				loadMethod: 'xhr',
				contentURL: 'pages/docs.html',
				width: 320,
				height: 320,
				x: 20,
				y: 60
			});
		});
	}
</pre>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to add links in windows that open other windows remember to add events to those links when the windows are created.</p>

<h3>Updating the Content of a Window</h3>
<p>Updating the content of a window requires that you know the ID property of the window. Setting the ID is an option when creating a window.</p>

You can change the content of a window by referring to:
<pre>
this.getSubElement($('windowID'), 'content');
</pre>

If you used the iframe load method, you can change the src of that window's iframe as follows:
<pre>
this.getSubElement($('windowID'), 'iframe').src = 'http://www.mydomain.com/';
</pre>

<h3>MooCanvas and ExCanvas</h3>
<p>Mocha UI now uses <a target="_blank" href="http://ibolmo.com/projects/moocanvas/">Moocanvas</a> for it's Internet Explorer canvas functionality. As an alternative you could also use <a target="_blank" href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">ExplorerCanvas</a>, though it requires some additional lines be added to the code in order to initialize the canvas element.</p>

<h3>Swiff and SWFobject</h3>
<p>I am using Swiff to load the example YouTube Flash now since Swiff is built into Mootools, but it has some performance issues when resizing, maximizing, and minimizing windows with Flash in them in Opera that SWFobject did not.</p>

<h3>General Issues</h3>
<p>If you have a solution for any of these please let me know.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the YouTube example, if the window is maximized and the video is playing, when the browser window is resized, the iframe the flash is in does not resize. This works fine however if the video is paused.</li>	
</ul>

<h3>Browser Performance Issues</h3>

<p>Opera 9</p>
<ul>
	<li>Though they don't bleed threw thankfully, you can move the scrollbars on windows that are behind other windows.</li>
	<li>Seems to have issues with Swiff, though you could use SWFobject instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mac Firefox 2  - Not fully supported</p>
<ul>
	<li>Has issues with Flash z-index.</li>
</ul>
